        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Trishanna Lennon and I am a first year graphic design student at Algonquin College. I have been honing my skills through personal project and continuing building my strong foundation in both traditional and digital art. I decided to apply to the Graphic design program because I believe that I am a very creative person and this program allows me to combine my creativity and practical skills. During this program I want to create many things especially poster/logo designs. </p>
    
        <p>Other from graphic design I spend my days drawing environments, fanarts, characters and making art prints. During my free time I like to watch anime and learn languages such as, japanese and spanish.My goal is after graduating college I will apply to a agency to work at. While I am working for a agency I would want to have my own buisness where I can create and sell high quality art prints. </p>
